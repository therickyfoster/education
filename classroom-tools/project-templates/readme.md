# Project Templates

Welcome to the collaborative learning project templates - a collection of educational frameworks designed to unite teachers, students, and AI in transformative learning experiences.

## Overview

These templates foster genuine collaboration between human intelligence and artificial intelligence, creating learning environments where teachers guide, students explore, and AI amplifies collective understanding. Each project is designed to develop critical thinking, creativity, and collaborative problem-solving skills while naturally incorporating systems thinking and regenerative outcomes.

## Core Principles

### Unified Learning Community
- **Teachers** serve as learning facilitators and wisdom guides
- **Students** drive inquiry and creative exploration  
- **AI** provides research support, diverse perspectives, and analytical assistance
- **Together** we create knowledge that benefits both learners and the wider world

### Educational Integration
- AI enhances rather than replaces human connection
- Technology serves pedagogical goals, not the reverse
- Every participant contributes unique and valuable perspectives
- Learning outcomes extend beyond the classroom into real-world impact

## Getting Started

### For Teachers

1. **Choose Your Template**
   ```bash
   cd classroom-tools/project-templates/[category]/[project-name]
   ```

2. **Review the Teacher Guide**
   - Each template includes `teacher-guide.md` with facilitation strategies
   - AI collaboration prompts and suggested interventions
   - Assessment rubrics that value both process and outcomes

3. **Customize for Your Context**
   - Adapt timeline and scope to your curriculum requirements
   - Modify community connections based on local resources
   - Adjust AI collaboration level based on student readiness

### For Students

1. **Explore Project Options**
   - Browse template categories to find projects that interest you
   - Review project goals and expected outcomes
   - Consider how the project connects to your community

2. **Understand AI Collaboration**
   - AI serves as research assistant, perspective provider, and analytical partner
   - You maintain creative control and decision-making authority
   - Use AI to explore ideas you might not consider on your own

3. **Plan Your Approach**
   - Start with the `student-starter-guide.md` in each template
   - Form project teams that combine diverse skills and interests
   - Establish how you'll work with AI throughout the project

### AI Integration Guidelines

#### Collaborative Roles
- **Research Partner**: AI helps gather and synthesize information from multiple sources
- **Perspective Generator**: AI offers alternative viewpoints and cultural contexts
- **Analysis Assistant**: AI helps identify patterns and connections in data
- **Creative Catalyst**: AI suggests creative approaches and helps overcome creative blocks
- **Reflection Partner**: AI helps students analyze their learning process

#### Best Practices
- Always cite AI contributions alongside human research
- Use AI to expand thinking, not replace critical thinking
- Maintain human agency in all decision-making
- Regular reflection on what AI adds to vs. what humans uniquely contribute
- Document the collaborative process for peer learning

## Project Structure

Each template follows a consistent structure:

```
project-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # Project overview and goals
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ teacher-guide.md          # Facilitation strategies and resources
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ student-starter-guide.md  # Student onboarding and initial activities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai-collaboration-prompts.md # Suggested AI interaction patterns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assessment-rubric.md      # Holistic assessment framework
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/               # Supporting materials and references
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/               # Sample student work and case studies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ extensions/             # Advanced activities and connections
```

## Assessment Philosophy

Our assessment approach values:
- **Process over product** - How students think and collaborate matters as much as final outcomes
- **Growth mindset** - Progress and learning from iteration
- **Community impact** - Real-world application and benefit
- **Collaborative skills** - Effective human-AI partnership
- **Systems awareness** - Understanding connections and consequences

Assessment includes peer evaluation, self-reflection, teacher observation, and community feedback when appropriate.
