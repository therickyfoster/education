## 🔍 Guiding Principles

<details>
<summary><strong>🌟 1. Holistic, Not Just Academic</strong></summary>

We value *personal growth*, *team contribution*, and *planetary alignment* as much as polished deliverables.

**Evidence might include:**
- Peer testimonials about collaboration
- Documentation of community impact
- Reflection on personal development
- Environmental consideration in projects

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔄 2. Process Over Product</strong></summary>

We reward learning from mistakes, adapting, and iteration—especially when students document their process openly.

**This looks like:**
- Documented iteration cycles
- Reflection on failures and pivots
- Public sharing of learning journey
- Transparent problem-solving approaches

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📈 3. Growth is Relative, Not Ranked</strong></summary>

Each learner is evaluated against **their own growth**, not against others. Rubrics are designed to support self-comparison over time.

> [!TIP]
> **Personal Growth Metrics:**
> - Week 1 vs Week 10 comparison
> - Skill development trajectory  
> - Confidence and autonomy increases
> - Learning velocity and depth

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>💬 4. Assessment Is Dialogical</strong></summary>

Teachers, students, and even AI agents are co-evaluators. Reflection, feedback loops, and mutual check-ins are built into each project.

**Feedback Sources:**
```
Student ←→ Teacher ←→ AI Agent
    ↕️         ↕️        ↕️
   Peer    Community  Mentor
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🗺️ 5. Rubrics Are Maps, Not Fences</strong></summary>

We offer flexible rubrics tailored to each project type. They are scaffolds for reflection—not rigid scorecards.

> [!WARNING]
> **Avoid:** Using rubrics as gatekeepers  
> **Embrace:** Using rubrics as growth guides

</details>

- **Version:** 2.0
- **Last Updated:** August 2025
- **Contributors:** Educational Philosophers, Students, AI Collaborators
- **License:** ## 🔒 License and Anti-Commercialization Protection Framework

### Comprehensive Intellectual Property Protection

This educational platform operates under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 with additional ethical use restrictions that prevent commercial exploitation while ensuring maximum accessibility for educational communities worldwide. Our licensing framework represents the most aggressive anti-commercialization protection available under international law, designed specifically to prevent intellectual property theft and unauthorized commercial capture of community-developed educational resources.

The licensing structure ensures that any commercial entity attempting to use this platform must comply fully with copyleft requirements that mandate public release of all derivative works, modifications, and related implementations under identical licensing terms. This framework creates substantial barriers to commercial exploitation while maintaining complete accessibility for legitimate educational applications.

### Commercial Use Prohibition and Legal Consequences

Commercial entities may not use this educational platform without demonstrating full compliance with GNU Affero General Public License version 3 copyleft requirements and ethical use restrictions. Violations result in immediate license termination and comprehensive legal enforcement designed to impose maximum available penalties while recovering community resources through mandatory public release of violator improvements and proprietary implementations.

Our legal enforcement strategy prioritizes outcomes that benefit the educational community through aggressive pursuit of statutory damages, injunctive relief preventing continued violations, comprehensive recovery of legal fees and enforcement costs, and mandatory disclosure of violating entity identities and business practices.

### Ethical Use Requirements and Community Protection

This platform may not be used by entities engaged in environmental harm, human rights violations, or extractive business practices that contradict our planetary restoration mission and community values. Ethical use restrictions specifically prohibit adoption by fossil fuel companies, organizations with documented environmental violations, entities that discriminate against protected groups, and commercial platforms that restrict educator or student access to educational resources.

Community protection measures ensure that collaborative educational development remains permanently accessible to educators and students while preventing commercial entities from privatizing innovations developed through community investment and collaborative effort.

### Active Monitoring and Violation Detection

We implement comprehensive monitoring systems designed to identify license violations and intellectual property theft across all digital platforms and commercial marketplaces. Detection capabilities include automated analysis of repository forks and derivatives for unauthorized commercial implementations, continuous surveillance of educational technology markets for proprietary versions of our platform, and community-driven reporting mechanisms that enable educators worldwide to identify and report potential violations.

Technical monitoring systems operate continuously to protect community interests, with particular attention to commercial entities attempting to rebrand or restructure our educational framework for proprietary commercial use without proper licensing compliance.

### Enforcement Commitment and Community Support

We maintain dedicated legal resources specifically allocated for intellectual property enforcement and license violation response. Our enforcement philosophy emphasizes maximum available legal penalties against violators, comprehensive public disclosure of all violations and enforcement actions, aggressive pursuit of remedies that benefit the educational community, and financial recovery that supports continued platform development and community protection activities.

Community support includes legal consultation for educators facing pressure from commercial entities, coordination of collective response to significant violations, and comprehensive documentation of enforcement actions that educates the broader educational community about intellectual property protection in collaborative educational development.

### Reporting Violations and Community Engagement

Educational community members can report suspected license violations or intellectual property theft through established channels that ensure prompt investigation and appropriate legal response. Violation reports should include complete entity identification and evidence of unauthorized commercial use, with particular attention to commercial platforms claiming ownership of community-developed educational content or implementing proprietary versions without proper attribution and licensing compliance.

Community engagement in violation detection and reporting provides essential protection for collaborative educational development while ensuring that commercial entities understand the serious legal consequences of attempting to privatize community-developed educational resources.

**Community Violation Reporting:** violations@planetaryrestorationarchive.org  
**Licensing Compliance Questions:** compliance@planetaryrestorationarchive.org

### International Protection and Cross-Border Enforcement

Intellectual property protection extends globally through established legal cooperation mechanisms and partner networks in major jurisdictions worldwide. Cross-border enforcement capabilities ensure that commercial entities face legal consequences regardless of their operational headquarters or corporate domicile, with particular emphasis on jurisdictions that provide strong protection for educational resources and collaborative development.

International enforcement coordination includes utilization of intellectual property treaties and diplomatic channels, strategic forum selection for maximum legal impact, and comprehensive documentation that supports enforcement actions across multiple jurisdictions simultaneously.

### Community Benefits and Resource Recovery

Our enforcement framework ensures that license violations ultimately benefit the educational community through recovery of innovations and improvements that commercial entities developed through unauthorized use of our platform. Violation consequences include automatic public domain release of violator improvements and derivative works, community access to enhanced educational features and technical innovations, and financial settlements that fund continued platform development and community protection activities.

Legal outcomes prioritize educational community benefit over purely punitive measures, ensuring that enforcement actions contribute to long-term platform sustainability and enhanced educational accessibility rather than merely imposing penalties on violating entities.
