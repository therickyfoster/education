# Community Partnership Guide

Building meaningful connections between classroom learning and community organizations to create authentic, impactful educational experiences.

## Partnership Philosophy

Community partnerships transform abstract learning into tangible impact by connecting student inquiry with real community needs. When teachers, students, and AI collaborate with community partners, learning becomes immediately relevant and students develop agency as contributing community members.

**Core Principles:**
- Students contribute meaningfully to community goals, not just observe
- Community partners gain genuine value from collaboration
- Learning objectives align with authentic community challenges
- AI enhances research, analysis, and communication between school and community
- Partnerships are reciprocal and mutually beneficial
