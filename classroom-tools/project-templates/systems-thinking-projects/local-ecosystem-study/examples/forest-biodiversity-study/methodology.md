## 📍 Study Site Design & Sampling Framework

### 🗺️ **Site Layout & Coordinate System**

#### **Study Area Boundaries**
- **Total Study Area:** 2.3 hectares within Miller Creek Forest Preserve
- **Coordinate System:** UTM Zone 16N (NAD83)
- **Reference Points:** 4 permanent GPS markers established at site corners
- **Trail Network:** 0.8 km of maintained trails within study boundary

#### **🎯 Sampling Design Framework**
```
📐 STRATIFIED DISTANCE SAMPLING
├── Zone 1: 0-5m from trail edge (High Impact)
├── Zone 2: 5-15m from trail edge (Moderate Impact)  
├── Zone 3: 15-30m from trail edge (Low Impact)
└── Zone 4: >30m from trail edge (Reference/Control)
```

**Visual Site Layout:**

    Stream──────────────────────🌿 Forest Edge

    Numbers = Distance zones from nearest trail
    Each zone has 6 systematically placed sampling plots
```

### 📏 **Plot Establishment Protocol**

#### **🎯 Plot Selection Criteria**
1. **Systematic spacing:** Minimum 50m between plots within same zone
2. **Representative habitat:** Avoid obvious microhabitat extremes (wet depressions, rock outcrops)
3. **Safety accessibility:** All plots reachable without off-trail damage
4. **Permanent marking:** Each plot center marked with discrete aluminum tag

#### **📐 Plot Specifications**
- **Plot Size:** 1m × 1m quadrats for plant sampling
- **Plot Shape:** Square quadrats using collapsible PVC frame
- **Orientation:** Random orientation to avoid directional bias
- **Permanence:** GPS coordinates recorded for exact relocation

#### **🔢 Sample Size Calculation**
**Target:** 24 total plots (6 plots × 4 distance zones)  
**Rationale:** 
- Power analysis suggested minimum n=5 per group for detecting 30% difference
- Extra plot per zone allows for data loss/weather issues
- Balanced design enables robust statistical comparison

## 📈 Statistical Analysis Planning

### 🧮 **Primary Analysis Framework**

#### **🎯 Analysis Objectives & Hypotheses**
```
📊 STATISTICAL TESTING PLAN
Primary Question: Trail proximity effects on plant communities

H1: Species richness decreases with trail proximity
├── Analysis: One-way ANOVA (richness ~ distance zone)
├── Post-hoc: Tukey HSD for pairwise comparisons
└── Effect size: Cohen's d for practical significance

H2: Invasive cover increases with trail proximity  
├── Analysis: Linear regression (invasive% ~ distance)
├── Model fit: R² and residual diagnostics
└── Confidence intervals: 95% CI for slope estimates
```

#### **📐 Statistical Methods Selection**

**Descriptive Statistics:**
- **Central tendency:** Mean, median for continuous variables
- **Variability:** Standard deviation, interquartile range
- **Distribution:** Histograms, Q-Q plots for normality assessment

Alpha level: 0.05 (Type I error rate)
Power target: 0.80 (80% chance of detecting true effect)
Sample size needed: n=6 per group (minimum)
Actual sample size: n=6 per group (meets requirements)
