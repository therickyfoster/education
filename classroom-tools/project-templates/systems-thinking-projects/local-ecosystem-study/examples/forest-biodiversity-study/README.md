## 📊 Research Framework

### ❓ **Primary Research Question**
> **"How does proximity to recreational trails affect plant and animal biodiversity in Miller Creek Forest Preserve?"**

### 🔬 **Supporting Questions**
1. **Species Composition:** What plant and animal species are present in different areas of the forest?
2. **Spatial Patterns:** How does species diversity change with distance from trails?
3. **Human Impacts:** What evidence of human impact is visible in different forest zones?
4. **Invasive Species:** Where are invasive species most concentrated, and why?
5. **Habitat Quality:** What environmental factors correlate with high biodiversity areas?

### 💭 **Hypotheses Tested**
- **H1:** Species diversity decreases within 10 meters of recreational trails
- **H2:** Invasive plant species are more abundant near trail systems
- **H3:** Ground-nesting bird species avoid areas with high human traffic
- **H4:** Soil compaction increases with proximity to trails
