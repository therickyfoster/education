- **Grid system:** Establish a systematic grid for consistent mapping
- **GPS coordinates:** Record precise latitude/longitude for key features

### Orientation & North Arrow
- **Always include a north arrow** on every map
- **Use a compass** to ensure accurate orientation
- **Align maps consistently** when creating multiple maps of the same area
- **Note magnetic vs. true north** if relevant for your location

### Symbols & Legend
**Standard Mapping Symbols:**
- **Trees:** Circles with different sizes for different species/ages
- **Shrubs:** Smaller circles or clusters
- **Water:** Blue lines (streams) or blue areas (ponds)
- **Elevation:** Contour lines or elevation numbers
