### **🚀 Lesson Flow**

#### **Opening Circle (10 minutes)**

**Teacher introduction:**
> "Today we're going to meet a new kind of learning partner - artificial intelligence. AI is not smarter than you, and it's not here to replace your thinking. It's a tool that can help us explore ideas, ask better questions, and think in new ways. Most importantly, you're always in charge of your learning journey."

**Quick survey (hands up):**
- Who has used AI before? 
- Who has questions about AI?
- Who has concerns about AI?
- Who is excited to try working with AI?

*Validate all responses. Normalize both excitement and apprehension.*

#### **AI Introduction Activity (20 minutes)**

**Step 1: First Contact (5 minutes)**
In pairs, students access chosen AI platform. First prompt for everyone:

> "Hello! I'm a [grade level] student just learning to work with AI. Can you introduce yourself and tell me three things I should know about how you work best with students?"

**Step 2: Getting to Know You (10 minutes)**
Students continue conversation with these prompts:
- "What kinds of questions do you enjoy helping with?"
- "What are some things you're not very good at?"
- "How should I fact-check information you give me?"
- "What should I remember about staying in control of my own learning?"

**Step 3: Share and Notice (5 minutes)**
Pairs share interesting responses. Teacher captures patterns on board:
- What did AI say it was good at?
- What limitations did it mention?
- What surprised you about its responses?

#### **Creating AI Partner Agreements (10 minutes)**

Students create personal agreements for AI interaction using this template:

**My AI Learning Partnership Agreement**
- **I will use AI to help me:** _(explore ideas, check my reasoning, brainstorm, etc.)_
- **I will NOT let AI:** _(think for me, make decisions for me, write my final work, etc.)_
- **When AI gives me information, I will:** _(check other sources, ask questions, think critically, etc.)_
- **If AI suggests something I don't understand, I will:** _(ask for clarification, research further, ask my teacher, etc.)_
- **I will be transparent about AI use by:** _(telling others when I've used AI, citing AI contributions, being honest, etc.)_

**Signature:** _________________ **Date:** _________________

#### **Reflection and Closing (5 minutes)**

**Exit ticket questions:**
1. One thing I learned about AI today:
2. One question I still have:
3. One way I want to use AI in my learning:
4. One concern I want to discuss more:

### **🚀 Lesson Flow**

#### **Hook: The Question Challenge (8 minutes)**

**Setup:** Choose current curriculum topic (e.g., Romeo and Juliet, photosynthesis, fractions, civil rights)

**Round 1 (3 minutes):** Students individually write down 3 questions about the topic - any questions at all.

**Round 2 (3 minutes):** In pairs, students craft 1 question they think will get the most interesting AI response.

**Round 3 (2 minutes):** Share a few examples. Don't judge quality yet - just notice variety.

#### **Question Quality Investigation (25 minutes)**

**Step 1: Testing Basic Questions (8 minutes)**
Each pair tests their question from the hook with AI. Sample results and notice:
- What kinds of responses do simple questions get?
- How long/detailed are the responses?
- What assumptions does AI make?

**Step 2: Leveling Up Questions (12 minutes)**
Introduce the **Question Quality Ladder**:

**Level 1: Basic facts** - "What is photosynthesis?"  
**Level 2: Connections** - "How does photosynthesis connect to climate change?"  
**Level 3: Perspectives** - "What would a plant scientist and an environmental activist say about photosynthesis differently?"  
**Level 4: Critical analysis** - "What assumptions underlie how we typically teach photosynthesis?"  
**Level 5: Creative synthesis** - "If you had to explain photosynthesis through the lens of social justice, what connections would you make?"

Students pick one level to try with their topic and test with AI.

**Step 3: Question Evolution (5 minutes)**
Based on AI responses, students craft follow-up questions that dig deeper or challenge assumptions.

#### **The Socratic AI Experience (7 minutes)**

Students flip the script and ask AI to question THEM:

> "Instead of me asking you questions about [topic], can you ask me thoughtful questions that help me think more deeply about this subject? Start with one question, and then build on my responses."

Students engage in this dialogue for 5-7 exchanges, with AI as the questioning partner.

#### **Reflection and Application (5 minutes)**

**Journal prompts:**
- How did different types of questions change AI's responses?
- What happened when AI questioned YOU instead?
- How might you use questioning techniques in other subjects?
- What did you notice about your own thinking when asked better questions?

**Tomorrow's challenge:**
Use one questioning technique from today in a different class or at home. Document what happens.
