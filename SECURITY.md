## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Educators

Educational institutions should implement these security measures:

- Review all AI-generated content before classroom use to ensure appropriateness
- Maintain strict student privacy protections when using AI tools
- Keep sensitive educational data separate from AI systems and cloud services
- Conduct regular reviews of third-party integrations and tools
- Establish clear data retention and deletion policies for student work
- Train staff on recognizing and reporting security concerns
- Implement access controls for educational technology systems

### For Students

Students should follow these safety guidelines:

- Never share personal information (full name, address, phone number) with AI systems
- Understand when and how AI is being used in your learning activities
- Report any uncomfortable, inappropriate, or concerning AI interactions immediately
- Maintain clear authorship and ownership of your creative work
- Use strong, unique passwords for any educational platforms
- Be cautious about downloading or installing educational software

### For Developers and Contributors

Technical contributors must adhere to secure development practices:

- Follow secure coding practices and conduct code reviews
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use encryption for any sensitive data transmission or storage
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Keep dependencies updated and monitor for known vulnerabilities
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration data
- Follow the principle of least privilege in system access

## Privacy Protection Framework

We adhere to comprehensive privacy protection standards:

### Educational Privacy Compliance
- **FERPA**: Full compliance with Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
- **COPPA**: Enhanced protections for students under 13 years of age  
- **GDPR**: Complete compliance for international users and data processing
- **State Privacy Laws**: Adherence to applicable state-level educational privacy requirements

### Data Minimalism Principles
- Collect only data that is essential for educational functionality
- Implement automatic data expiration and deletion policies
- Provide clear opt-out mechanisms for all data collection
- Regular audits of data collection and usage practices

### AI-Specific Privacy Protections
- Student inputs to AI systems are not used for model training
- AI interactions are logged minimally and deleted regularly
- Clear disclosure of all AI data processing activities
- Student consent mechanisms for AI-enhanced learning activities

## Incident Response Procedures

### Classification Levels

**Critical (Severity 1)**
- Student safety or privacy compromised
- Unauthorized access to educational records
- Malicious content generation affecting multiple users
- System compromise affecting core functionality

**High (Severity 2)**  
- Potential privacy violations
- Significant functionality disruption
- Authentication or authorization failures
- Data integrity concerns

**Medium (Severity 3)**
- Minor privacy concerns
- Limited functionality issues
- Non-critical security improvements needed

### Response Actions

For each incident classification, we implement structured response procedures including stakeholder notification, containment measures, investigation protocols, and recovery plans. Educational institutions using our resources will be notified immediately of any incidents that could affect their environments.
