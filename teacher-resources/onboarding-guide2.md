## ü§î Common Concerns (And Real Responses)

### **"I don't understand technology well enough."**

You don't need to understand the mechanics of internal combustion to drive a car. The technology serves the pedagogy, not the other way around. Your expertise in understanding how humans learn is exactly what's needed to guide this integration ethically.

### **"What about cheating and academic integrity?"**

This is the wrong question. The right question is: "How do we help students develop authentic voice and genuine understanding in an AI-abundant world?" 

We're not preventing students from using AI‚Äîwe're teaching them to use it with integrity, transparency, and wisdom.

### **"My administration won't support this."**

Start small. Start with curiosity. Share student reflections, not policy proposals. Let the evidence of student engagement and ethical thinking speak for itself. Our [institutional resources](../institutional/implementation-roadmap.md) can help when you're ready for broader adoption.

### **"What if I make a mistake?"**

Mistakes are learning opportunities‚Äîfor you and your students. The key is transparency, reflection, and continuous improvement. Every pioneer makes course corrections along the way.

# ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Framework for AI-Integrated Education

*These aren't just policies. They're promises to the next generation.*

## üåü Core Commitment

We believe that artificial intelligence should amplify human potential, not replace human judgment. Every decision we make prioritizes student agency, emotional safety, and authentic learning over efficiency or performance metrics.

This framework serves as both practical guidance and philosophical foundation for educators integrating AI into their practice.

---

## üéØ The Five Pillars of Ethical AI Education

### **1. üëë Student Agency First**

**Principle:** Students maintain meaningful control over their AI interactions and learning journey.

**In Practice:**
- Students choose when and how to engage with AI tools
